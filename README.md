`Domain Kata` provides [Kata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata) for domain models that focuses on practice of model-based development such as [domain-driven design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and [generative programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_programming#Generative_programming), etc. in your project. By using `Domain Kata` in your project, it makes easy to identify models in the project, so it allows you to design any package structure (stop using the `Model` package in your libraries!). And `Domain Kata` will be a base for a domain-oriented framework which takes advantage of type constraints.
